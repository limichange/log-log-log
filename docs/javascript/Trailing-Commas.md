# Trailing-Commas

Trailing commas (sometimes called 'final commas') can be useful when adding new elements, pareameters, or properties to JavaScript code. If you want to add a new property, you can simply add a new line without modifying the perviously last line if that line alerady uses a trailing comma. This maskes version-control diffs cleaner and editing code might be less troublesome.

JavaScript has allowed trailing commas in array literals since the beginning, and later added them to object literals(ECMAScript 5) and most recently (ECMAScript 2017) to function parameters.

JSON, however, disallows trailing commas.
